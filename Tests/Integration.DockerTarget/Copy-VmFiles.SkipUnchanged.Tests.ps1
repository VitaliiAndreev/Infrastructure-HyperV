# Integration tests for Copy-VmFiles' skip-unchanged path against a real
# SSH target. See Initialize-DockerTargetEnvironment.ps1 for environment
# details.
#
# Each It block writes one host source file and ships it to the VM via
# Copy-VmFiles. The reconcile-or-write behaviour is observed indirectly
# through the target's mtime: an unchanged re-run must leave it untouched
# (the reconcile block short-circuited before any sudo write), and any
# drift dimension - content, owner, mode - must advance it (the write
# block ran and re-applied the requested state). Unit tests already pin
# the emitted script shape; this file proves the script actually does
# the right thing end-to-end.
