# Test-SshBanner
#   Connects to <IpAddress>:<Port>, reads up to a few bytes, and returns
#   $true iff the bytes start with the SSH protocol banner prefix ("SSH-").
#   Returns $false on TCP connect failure, timeout, or a non-SSH response.
#
#   Why this beats a bare TCP probe through a tunnel:
#     - SSH.NET's ForwardedPortLocal listener accepts the TCP socket the
#       moment ForwardedPortLocal.Start() returns. A TCP-only probe
#       therefore succeeds INSTANTLY against a tunnel whose far end may
#       not have sshd running yet - the listener accepts, SSH.NET tries
#       to open the direct-tcpip channel, the channel-open fails because
#       the workload's port 22 is silent, SSH.NET tears the local socket
#       down a few hundred ms later - by which time the caller already
#       believed the probe succeeded and moved on.
#     - The SSH banner is the first thing the SERVER sends after the TCP
#       3-way handshake. If we receive it, SSH.NET successfully opened
#       the channel AND the workload's sshd is actually serving on the
#       far side. If the connection drops without sending the banner,
#       the workload is not yet ready.
#
#   The 16-byte read is a conservative ceiling - the OpenSSH banner is
#   typically ~24 bytes ("SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1\r\n"), and we only need
#   the first 4 bytes ("SSH-") to confirm protocol speaker. Reading more
#   would only delay the success path.
