# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New-VmSshTunnel
#   Opens an SSH session to a jump host and configures a local TCP port
#   forward so traffic to 127.0.0.1:<assigned-port> emerges at
#   <TargetIp>:<TargetPort> on the far side of the jump. This is how the
#   provisioner reaches workload VMs after feature 53 moved them onto a
#   per-environment private switch the host has no route to.
#
#   Why a local port forward (not native ProxyJump):
#     - SSH.NET (the library every other SSH cmdlet in this stack is
#       built on) has no native ProxyJump (`-J`) support. Local port
#       forwarding is the closest equivalent SSH.NET ships out of the
#       box: it gives a localhost endpoint that any TCP-aware caller
#       (Test-VmSshPort, a fresh SshClient connect, etc.) can use
#       without knowing about the jump.
#     - Reusing a single jump session for the whole VM lifecycle (one
#       wait-for-SSH probe loop + one post-provisioning session) saves
#       the cost of re-handshaking the jump on every probe iteration.
#
#   The returned object exposes:
#     - LocalHost / LocalPort : the loopback endpoint callers connect to.
#     - JumpClient / Forward  : the underlying SSH.NET objects, kept for
#                               disposal and so callers that need to
#                               run commands on the jump itself can do
#                               so without re-opening a session.
#     - Dispose()             : tears down the forward and the jump
#                               session in the right order. ALWAYS call
#                               it in a finally block.
