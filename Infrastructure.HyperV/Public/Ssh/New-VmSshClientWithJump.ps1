# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New-VmSshClientWithJump
#   Opens an SSH client to a VM, transparently routing through a jump
#   host when one is required.
#
#   Two paths:
#     - Direct (router VMs, or any VM the host has L2 reach to):
#       calls New-VmSshClient directly. No tunnel.
#     - Jumped (workload VMs after feature 53 - host has no route to
#       the per-environment private subnet): opens New-VmSshTunnel
#       against the workload's `_RouterVm` neighbour, then connects
#       a fresh SshClient to localhost:<LocalPort> using the
#       workload's credentials. The SSH session piggybacks the
#       tunnel's forwarded port; bytes flow workload <-> router <->
#       host transparently.
#
#   Returns a session object holding both the SshClient and (when
#   jumped) the underlying tunnel. Callers MUST call .Dispose() in
#   a finally block - it tears the client down first, then the
#   tunnel, so the forward closes cleanly.
#
#   Decision rule: a `_RouterVm` NoteProperty signals "jump required".
#   provision.ps1 step 7 stamps it onto every workload VM def from
#   Group-VmsByEnvironment, so callers do not need to know about
#   environments or routing themselves.
