# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# New-VmSshClient
#   Creates and connects a Renci.SshNet.SshClient using password
#   authentication. Returns the connected client; the caller is responsible
#   for calling Disconnect() and Dispose() in a finally block.
#
#   SSH.NET is used directly rather than Posh-SSH cmdlets because
#   ConnectionInfoGenerator in Posh-SSH 3.x drops algorithm entries from
#   the SSH.NET ConnectionInfo, breaking key exchange against OpenSSH 9.x
#   (Ubuntu 24.04). Posh-SSH must still be installed - it ships the
#   Renci.SshNet.dll the function depends on.
#
#   Renci types are referenced inside the function body (not as parameter
#   types) so the module imports cleanly on hosts without Posh-SSH. The
#   Assert-SshNetLoaded guard turns the otherwise opaque "type not found"
#   error into an actionable message naming the missing prerequisite.
#
#   -Timeout caps the total Connect() wall-clock. SSH.NET applies the
#   same value to both socket-read and KEX, so a long Timeout is the
#   right knob when a slow server-side responder (e.g. sshd held off
#   by cloud-config until users are created) needs more than SSH.NET's
#   30s default. The Connect call is synchronous - the caller pays a
#   single block of up to -Timeout with no console output in between.
#   Consumers waiting on multi-minute connects should print a leading
#   "this may take a few minutes" line so the silence does not read
#   like a hang.
#
#   Security:
#   - SSH.NET accepts any host key by default (no HostKeyReceived handler).
#     Equivalent to Posh-SSH's -AcceptKey. Acceptable on a private Hyper-V
#     network with statically provisioned IPs; do NOT use on untrusted
#     networks without supplying a fingerprint check.
#   - Password is required as a plain string by SSH.NET's
#     PasswordAuthenticationMethod constructor. Callers should source the
#     value from SecretManagement and avoid logging it.
