.SYNOPSIS
    Stages a host-side gzipped tarball to a Hyper-V VM and extracts it
    into <Destination> atomically under sudo.

.DESCRIPTION
    Single-round-trip primitive that joins the existing FileServer family
    (Add-VmFileServerFile, Invoke-WithVmFileServer) with a remote
    extract-then-swap step. The cmdlet performs the host-side stage, then
    one SSH call that:

      1. Creates a sibling tempdir under the destination's parent
         (`<parent>/.expand.XXXXXX`).
      2. Streams the tarball over HTTP and pipes the bytes into
         `sudo tar -xzf -` with the caller-supplied `--strip-components`.
      3. Removes any existing object at <Destination> (file, symlink, or
         directory tree).
      4. Renames the tempdir to <Destination>.

    The mktemp + extract + mv sequence is what makes the swap atomic from
    any observer's point of view: <Destination> either points at the old
    tree or the freshly extracted tree, never at a half-populated dir.
    The cmdlet does NOT install a trap for crash cleanup - if the remote
    script is killed between mktemp and mv, the tempdir is left as a
    sibling and the next clean run finds <Destination> unchanged. That
    is intentional: making cleanup the caller's problem keeps the
    primitive single-purpose and is what the integration test suite
    verifies.

    Skip-unchanged is gated by a marker file
    (`<Destination>/.infra-hyperv-tarball.sha256`) that records the
    SHA-256 of the source tarball bytes. The digest is computed
    host-side once per call so the VM never has to read the whole
    tarball back. On a match the remote script exits before any
    `curl` / `tar` / `mv`. The marker is itself written into the
    fresh tempdir before the final rename, so the dir-swap leaves
    <Destination> in a state where the next call can short-circuit.
    Pass -NoSkipUnchanged to force a re-extract (the marker is still
    written, so subsequent default calls can short-circuit again).

    Path validation is host-side and runs before any staging or SSH:
    <Destination> must be a non-empty absolute path with no `..`
    segments, no NUL byte, and no single quote (the remote script
    embeds it inside a single-quoted bash assignment, matching the rest
    of the module). <TarballPath> must exist on the host so the
    Add-VmFileServerFile call cannot fail late in the flow.
    <StripComponents> is a non-negative integer that flows through to
    `tar --strip-components` verbatim.

.PARAMETER SshClient
    A live Renci.SshNet.SshClient. The caller owns the client's
    lifecycle - this function neither connects nor disposes it.

.PARAMETER Server
    The file server handle returned by Start-VmFileServer (or received as
    the script-block argument from Invoke-WithVmFileServer). Forwarded
    verbatim to Add-VmFileServerFile to stage <TarballPath>.

.PARAMETER TarballPath
    Absolute path on the Windows host to a gzipped tar archive
    (e.g. `E:\cache\jdk-21.tar.gz`). The file is staged into the live
    server and pulled down over HTTP by the VM.

.PARAMETER Destination
    Absolute path on the VM where the extracted tree should live. The
    parent directory is created if missing; the destination itself is
    replaced atomically (rm -rf then mv from a sibling tempdir).

.PARAMETER StripComponents
    Non-negative integer passed to `tar --strip-components`. Defaults to
    0 (no stripping). Set to 1 to discard a single wrapper directory
    inside the tarball.

.PARAMETER NoSkipUnchanged
    Forces the extract path even when the on-VM marker file already
    records the host-computed SHA-256 of the source tarball. Off by
    default - the skip-unchanged branch produces identical observable
    state at lower cost. Use this switch when callers want to be sure
    the destination's mtime advances or when recovering from
    out-of-band tampering inside <Destination>.

.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-WithVmFileServer -VmIpAddress '10.10.0.50' -ScriptBlock {
        param($server)
        Expand-VmTarball -SshClient $ssh -Server $server `
            -TarballPath 'E:\cache\jdk-21.tar.gz' `
            -Destination '/opt/jdk-21' -StripComponents 1
    }

.NOTES
    On-VM commands run under sudo so the function can write to
    privileged locations regardless of which user the SSH client
    authenticated as. The caller is responsible for ensuring that user
    has password-less sudo.
