# Get-VmKvpIpAddress
#   Polls Hyper-V's KVP integration services (Get-VMNetworkAdapter +
#   .IPAddresses) until the supplied VM reports an IPv4 address on the
#   requested switch, then returns that address. Throws on deadline.
#
#   Why this lives in the module:
#     The provisioner's create-vm.ps1 needs to wait for a DHCP-mode
#     router VM's upstream IP before SSH-probing it; the E2E harness
#     needs to do the same on the test side because the discovered IP
#     never propagates back across the child-process boundary
#     provision.ps1 ran behind. Both call sites converged on the same
#     polling loop with the same "is the VM still Running?" guard, the
#     same IPv4-vs-IPv6 filter, and the same deadline/timeout error
#     surface - so it belongs in one place.
#
#   What the caller still owns:
#     - The UX. -OnPoll fires once per no-IP-yet iteration so the
#       provisioner can paint Write-Host dots and the E2E harness can
#       stay silent without forking two near-identical helpers.
#     - The "is this VM static or DHCP?" branch. This helper assumes
#       the caller already decided IP discovery is needed; it does not
#       inspect $Vm.ipAddress itself.
#     - Stamping the result back onto a VM def via Add-Member when the
#       caller wants reference-shared downstream access. Returning a
#       plain string keeps the helper testable without object-identity
#       semantics.
#
#   -SwitchName is the multi-NIC discriminator. Router VMs have two
#   adapters (one on the external switch, one on a per-environment
#   private switch); without -SwitchName the helper would race-pick
#   whichever NIC KVP reported first. When -SwitchName is omitted the
#   first adapter wins (the typical workload case where the VM has a
#   single NIC).
