.SYNOPSIS
    Copies host files to a Hyper-V VM via the host file server and SSH.

.DESCRIPTION
    For each entry in -Entries, stages the host file via Add-VmFileServerFile
    and runs (under sudo on the VM): mkdir -p of the parent target dir, curl
    -fsSL -o of the staged URL, then chown / chmod to the requested values.

    By default the per-entry remote script first reconciles against the VM:
    it computes sha256sum on the target and stat -c '%U:%G %a' for owner +
    mode, compares against the host-computed SHA-256 and the requested owner
    and mode, and exits 0 with no writes when all three match. Any mismatch
    falls through to the existing mkdir/curl/chown/chmod sequence. Both the
    reconcile and the write share a single SSH round-trip per entry.

    Pass -NoSkipUnchanged to force the always-write path (e.g. recovering
    from out-of-band tampering where the reconcile would otherwise skip).

    This is a pure transport primitive. It has no opinion on where the
    entries came from or what they semantically represent - the caller
    owns the schema and any policy around what is allowed in their
    context.

    Each entry is processed in its own SSH round-trip so a per-entry error
    message can name both source and target. Errors abort - downstream
    entries are not attempted, mirroring the behaviour of "set -e" in a
    shell script.

.PARAMETER SshClient
    A live Renci.SshNet.SshClient. The caller owns the client's lifecycle.
    Connecting and disposing is NOT the responsibility of this function.

.PARAMETER Server
    A file-server handle returned by Start-VmFileServer or supplied by
    Invoke-WithVmFileServer's scriptblock. The handle's BaseUrl is used
    by Add-VmFileServerFile to construct the per-entry URL.

.PARAMETER Entries
    An array of entry descriptors. Each entry MUST expose:
      - Source : a host path that already exists.
      - Target : an absolute Linux path on the VM.
    Each entry MAY expose:
      - Owner  : a chown argument string. Defaults to 'root:root'. Pass
                 'user' or 'user:group' as you would to chown directly.
      - Mode   : a chmod argument string. Defaults to '0644'.

    Hashtables and PSCustomObjects both work. Validation of these fields
    against any caller-specific schema is the caller's responsibility;
    Assert-VmFilesField in this module provides the shared shape checks.

.PARAMETER NoSkipUnchanged
    Forces the always-write path - every entry runs mkdir -p + curl + chown
    + chmod regardless of whether the VM-side state already matches. Off by
    default; the skip-unchanged path produces the same observable state at
    lower cost, so callers only need this switch to force a re-write.

.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-WithVmFileServer -VmIpAddress '10.10.0.50' -ScriptBlock {
        param($server)
        $sshClient = New-VmSshClient -IpAddress '10.10.0.50' -Username 'admin' -Password 'secret'
        try {
            Copy-VmFiles -SshClient $sshClient -Server $server -Entries @(
                @{ Source = 'C:\jars\foo.jar'; Target = '/opt/lib/foo.jar' },
                @{ Source = 'C:\seed.json';    Target = '/var/data/seed.json'; Owner = 'app'; Mode = '0640' }
            )
        }
        finally {
            if ($sshClient.IsConnected) { $sshClient.Disconnect() }
            $sshClient.Dispose()
        }
    }

.NOTES
    All on-VM commands are issued under sudo so the function can satisfy
    any combination of Owner/Mode regardless of which user the SSH client
    authenticated as. The caller is responsible for ensuring that user
    has password-less sudo (cloud-init's default admin user does).
